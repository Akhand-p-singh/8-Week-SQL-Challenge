### Case Study Questions

#### In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales: ####

* Convert the week_date to a DATE format

* Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

* Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

* Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

* Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

        | segment     | age_band      |
        |--------     |-------------- |
        | 1           | Young Adults  |
        | 2           | Middle Aged   |
        | 3 or 4      | Retirees      |

* Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:

        | segment     | demographic |
        |--------     |-----------  |
        | C           | Couples     |
        | F           | Families    |

* Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

* Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
