### **Q7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?**
---
### **Q8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?**
---
### **Q9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

```
SELECT 
      calender_year,
	  platform,
	  Round(AVG( avg_transaction),0) as avg_transaction
from clean_weekly_sales
group by calender_year, platform
order by calender_year
```
#### Output:

| calendar_year | platform | avg_transaction | 
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
