### **Q1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

```sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT node_id) no_of_nodes
from customer_nodes
```
#### Output:
| no_of_nodes  |
|--------------|
| 5            |

### **Q2. What is the number of nodes per region?**

```
SELECT cn.region_id,r.region_name, COUNT(node_id) as no_of_nodes
from customer_nodes cn
join regions r
on cn.region_id = r.region_id
group by cn.region_id, region_name
order by region_id

```
#### Output:
| region_id | region_name | nodes  |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1         | Australia   | 770    |
| 2         | America     | 735    |
