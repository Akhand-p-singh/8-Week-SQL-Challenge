#### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

```
SELECT s.customer_id, p.plan_name, s.start_date,DATEDIFF(day, LAG(start_date) over(partition by customer_id order by customer_id),start_date) as day_diff
from plans p
join subscriptions s
on p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE customer_id in (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16)
```
#### Output:
