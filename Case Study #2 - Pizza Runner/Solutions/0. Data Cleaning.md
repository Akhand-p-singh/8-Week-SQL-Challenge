# üçï Case Study #2: Pizza Runner

# üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning

## Table: customer_orders

### Steps:

There are some null and blank value in exclusions and extras and we have to clean those into NULL. 

```
select order_id, customer_id, pizza_id, 
CASE
     WHEN exclusions = 'NULL' then NULL
     else exclusions
END as exclusions,
Case 
     WHEN extras = 'NULL' then NULL
      else extras
END as extras, order_time
INTO cleaned_customer_orders
from customer_orders
```

## Table: runner_data 

### Steps: 

In runner_data table along which null value we have to also clean distance and duration columns. For these we have to trim the columns and remove km, kms, minute, minutes from the columns. 
```
 UPDATE runner_orders
 SET cancellation = 'Null'
 WHERE cancellation = 'NULL'
```
```
Update runner_orders
set duration = 'NULL'
WHERE duration = 'LL'
```

Here we removed 'km' from distance column. 

```
SELECT Trim('km' from distance)
from runner_orders
```
 
 Here we updated the column.
```
update runner_orders set distance=TRIM('km' from distance)
```

We used this remove minutes from duration column
```
update runner_orders set duration=TRIM('minutes' from duration)
```
