## üöÄ Solutions

### **Q1. How many unique transactions were there?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(Distinct txn_id) AS unique_transaction
from sales
```

#### Output:
| unique_transaction |
|--------------      |
| 2500               |

---

### **Q2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?**

```SQL
SELECT cast(AVG(total_prod) as float) as avg_product_purchased
from (
SELECT txn_id, count(prod_id) AS total_prod
from sales 
group by txn_id ) f
```
#### Output:
|  avg_product_purchased |
|-------------           |
| 6                      |

---
### **Q3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?**

```

WITH revenue_list AS ( 
SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty * price ) AS revenue
from sales
group by txn_id ) 
SELECT Distinct PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) within group (order by revenue) over() AS pct_25th,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) within group (order by revenue) over() AS pct_50th,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) within group (order by revenue) over() AS pct_75th
from revenue_list


```

#### Output:
| pct_25th | pct_50th | pct_75th  |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 375.75   | 509.5    | 647       |

---
### **Q4. What is the average discount value per transaction?**

```
SELECT cast(Avg(total_trans) as decimal (5,2)) AS avg_disc
from (
SELECT txn_id, sum(qty * price * discount/100.0) AS total_trans
from sales
group by txn_id ) t

```
#### Output:
| total_trans                   |
|-------------------------------|
| 62.49                         |


---

### **Q5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?**

```
SELECT 
       CAST(100.0 * Count(DISTINCT Case when member = 1 then txn_id end) / Count(DISTINCT txn_id ) AS float) AS member,
       CAST(100.0 *COUNT(DISTINCT Case when member = 0 then txn_id end)/ Count(DISTINCT txn_id ) AS float)  AS non_member
from sales

```

#### Output:
| member  | non_member   |
|---------|--------------|
| 60.2    | 39.8         |

---

### **Q6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?**

```
WITH revenue AS  
( 
SELECT  member, txn_id,  sum(qty * price )	AS total_transaction						   
from sales
group by member, txn_id
)
SELECT member, CAST(AVG(1.0*total_transaction) as decimal(10,2)) AS avg_revenue
from revenue 
group by member
```
#### Output:

| member | avg_revenue  |
|--------|--------------|
| 0      | 515.04       |
| 1      | 516.27       |
